# PopularMoviesStage1
This is an Android app to discover popular and top rated movies of Hollywood. I developed this app as project 1 for my Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree  course.


### The MovieDb API Key is required.

In order for this app to function properly, an API key for themoviedb.org must be included with the build.

Please obtain a key via the following [instructions](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup), and include the unique api key for the build by replacing `<YOUR_API_KEY>` in the following line of [USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties

`MyTheMovieDbApiKey="<YOUR_API_KEY>"`

Go to last line of [USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties file and replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your own api key.
